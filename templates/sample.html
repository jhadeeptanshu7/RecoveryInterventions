                SMARTS (Social Media based drug Addiction Recovery intervention Targetting web Server) is a web server that utilizes supervised machine
                learning, natural language processing, and causal analysis techniques to automatically determine high
                yield responders to drug addiction recovery interventions. SMARTS can further assist the epidemiologists
                and public health officials in analyzing the sentiment of the posts, identifying the drug, and recovery
                terms, different topics, and the location information present in the posts of the users.
                SMARTS is part of our effort to provide publicly available technologies that can be used by
                epidemiologists to identify individuals open to drug addiction recovery interventions and help curb the
                opioid epidemic.
