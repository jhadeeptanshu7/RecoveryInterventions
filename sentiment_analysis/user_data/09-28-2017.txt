I have two computers. A desktop and laptop. I'm selling the desktop and want to import my Edge browser favorites into my laptop Edge browser. So I went into the Edge settings and clicked "Export to file" which created a HTML file. I transferred it to the laptop and tried to import it into the Edge there. However, it didn't seem to work. What's the deal here? Is it a broken feature?
