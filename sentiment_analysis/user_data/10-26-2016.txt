Got the DLC and haven't played in years. Can someone explain refineries to me? I don't understand how they work. Also, trade outposts. I've just been spamming both of them because I don't understand the mechanics of them. Also, how does the "Demolition Team" ability work on that TEC capital ship? Does it just go around blowing up your own ships or what?
