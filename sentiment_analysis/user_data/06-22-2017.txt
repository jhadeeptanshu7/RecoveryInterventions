I'm playing as Japan and I have to say that I'm extremely annoyed with the naval invasions. It's a huge pain in the ass to set up a naval invasion. Especially because there are so many different island groups to invade. Once or twice wouldn't be bad, but the need to invade a million different islands and fend off constant naval invasions is really annoying. It makes me not even want to play. 

I don't know why naval invasions have to be such a pain to do.
