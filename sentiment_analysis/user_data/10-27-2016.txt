I'm new to Kava and have been increasing my dose. At first I felt nothing, but as I increased my dose I started to feel something. The best way I can describe it is that I felt very slightly drunk and it made me tired. Like I had one beer or something. I didn't notice any other effects like euphoria or increased sociability or anything.
