I've been playing the mod for a few days, currently as Robb Stark. One weird and annoying thing I've noticed is that some of my Lords will randomly leave the Kingdom. Especially in The Trident area. My Kingdom is just fracturing. Sometimes I'm able to immediately offer them vassalization to come back in which they accept. However, why is this happening in the first place?
