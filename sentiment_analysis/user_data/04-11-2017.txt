I really think that Bipolar SOs go through just as much pain as their Bipolar partners do. I know I certainly did. It caused me severe depression for years afterwards. I was on the receiving end of a lot of undeserved cruelty. Now, if I had known that my SO was Bipolar and I had a support network things might not have been as bad for me.
