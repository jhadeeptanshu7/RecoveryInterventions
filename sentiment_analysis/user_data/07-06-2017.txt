I'm watching the new show Jamestown and it reminded me how brutal the first colonization attempts were. With fighting between European colonists and Natives, entire colonies disappearing or being abandoned, starvation, disease, failed attempts at resupplying the colonies, and even cannibalism. 

It doesn't seem to me like the game models these things very well or at all and that makes me sad.
