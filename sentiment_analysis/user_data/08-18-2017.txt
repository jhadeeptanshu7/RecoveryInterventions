So if the enemy has aircraft in the air and has air superiority (51%?) then all of your Divisions in the region take a huge movement speed penalty when moving. 

However, that doesn't make sense to me because aircraft do not attack Divisions that are merely moving. They can only attack Divisions that are in combat. So your Divisions are getting a huge speed penalty just because there are enemy aircraft in the air.

Am I missing something or is this just illogical?
