I was just wiping my Strafe RGB keyboard with a disinfecting wipe and the metallic looking Corsair logo on the right side came right off. About a third of the letters just came off. 

This is really disappointing and cheap feeling considering how much money I paid for the keyboard. I don't know if I will try to glue the letters back on or just rip the rest of them off.
