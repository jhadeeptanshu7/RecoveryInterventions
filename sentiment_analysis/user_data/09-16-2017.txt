I've had nothing, but problems with my free FreedomPop service since getting it a few months ago. It will work fine for a while and then I'll stop receiving calls or texts or both. I had to go through a multi-week process to fix it last time. FreedomPop did something on their end and eventually fixed it. However, now it's not working again. For whatever reason I'm not receiving any phone calls.

Is this just to be expected with FreedomPop? I can't continue to deal with this. I'm going to have to switch providers if this continues. I have the AT&T LTE SIM in a Nexus 5.
