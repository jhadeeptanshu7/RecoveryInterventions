I'm playing a game as Halfdan Whiteshirt with the CK2+ mod. I have a fourth son and he wasn't doing anything so I sent him to form a mercenary company. The game says I will get a cut of their profits, but I can't figure out where to see how much money it's bringing me. Does anyone know? 

It's pretty expensive to increase the size or composition of the mercenary company. So I really need to know how much money they're bringing me to know if it's worth it to give them more money.
