In the older games the in game encyclopedia was really nice and I spent a lot of time reading it. The historical descriptions were fascinating. The in-battle spell browser is really nice and is basically the same thing, but only for during battles and about spells.

I think it would be really awesome if the spell browser was expanded to include all the information about the game and could be viewed on the campaign map. It would be really cool to see the unit models in that and read longer lore descriptions of everything.
