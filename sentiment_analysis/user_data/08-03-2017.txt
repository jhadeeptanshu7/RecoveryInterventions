Is anyone else really annoyed by this mechanic? I don't really understand the point of it other than to handicap the player. It's especially annoying if you're playing a minor nation and you really need to make better Divisions, but simple aren't allowed because of "reasons". 

It just doesn't seem like a good mechanic to me. There has to be a better way of doing it.
