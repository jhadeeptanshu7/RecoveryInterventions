I recently discovered GOG early this year. Since then I have added a metric shit ton of games to my library. I have a newfound love for old games now. Games that I wanted to play as a child, but did not have the money or brainpower for. Games that I played as a teenager. I have ceased buying newer games. I can get 4 old games for the price of a new one and they are in many cases better games than the new ones.

Something I love that GOG does is they do some basic compatibility work to ensure every games runs on modern systems. They also sometimes include community fixes into games and special content. The GOG version of Splinter Cell for example has content that the Steam version does not.
