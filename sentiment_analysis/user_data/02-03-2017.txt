I'm selling the Nexus 7 2013 16GB Wi-Fi version that I bought in early 2014. It's served me well, but I got a new tablet for Christmas. The official case and charger are included. There are some scratches on the screen and cosmetic damage on the back and corners. Asking price is $95, shipping included.
