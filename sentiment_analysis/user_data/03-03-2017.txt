I'm not yet a big student of Star Wars lore, but I've played a lot of the games, watched all the movies, and watched all the TV shows. One thing that I've noticed is how technology in the Star Wars universe seems to not change much at all. Even with thousands of years in between the technology seems basically the same. Has technology become stagnant in Star Wars? Is there some other explanation?
