Ridley really seems to have it in for his lead characters. It really bummed me out to see what happened to Shaw and Daniels at the end of their movies. Especially Shaw who I grew to really like by the end of the movie. Daniels I didn't care that much about to be honest. But why does he do this to his leads?
