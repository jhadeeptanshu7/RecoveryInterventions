I think it would be really cool if CA remastered all the old titles. They could make them compatible with modern OS's, add high resolution support, widescreen support, Steam multiplayer, Steam Workshop, Steam Achievement, Steam Cloud saving, and Steam Trading Card support, etc. Also release them on GOG.

It would also be good practice before working on the next major historical title. :)
