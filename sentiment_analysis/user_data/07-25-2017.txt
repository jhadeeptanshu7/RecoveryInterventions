I would really like the ability to alter the composition of Support Companies and Line Battalions. Most people probably wouldn't use this, but for a roleplayer like me who wants to create historically accurate Divisions it would be awesome. Also, the 5 limit on Support Companies per Division would need to be lifted in order to facilitate historically accurate Divisions. I see no reason why there is a 5 limit in the first place. If a player wants to create very strong Divisions that use a lot of equipment/supply then they should be able to.
