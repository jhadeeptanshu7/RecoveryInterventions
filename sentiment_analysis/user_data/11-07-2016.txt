This time it's kratom, a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant. People have used it for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years for physical pain, fever reduction, diarrhea, coughs, hypertension, anxiety, depression, insomnia, fatigue, PTSD, etc. Many people have used it to help break their opiate or alcohol addiction. Kratom has saved countless lives in this way. 

In lower doses it's energizing and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it is not an opiate. It is about as habit forming as coffee. The primary alkaloid in kratom, mitragynine, is also present in the coffee plant. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands of (possibly more than 10,000) American kratom small businesses.

The DEA tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. They cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. They later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which are undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, food allergies, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is portraying then there would be millions of dead people. They were actually going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin which is beyond absurd and frankly insane. 

After the large public backlash the DEA temporarily retracted the ban. This has never happened before in the entire history of the DEA. It is historic. They are now doing a public commenting period on the Regulations.gov website (on track for the most comments ever) until December 1st while the FDA does an 8 factor analysis on kratom.

As an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada, kratom is completely legal and classified as a NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that "Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents." The Florida Department of Health added that, "there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida." 

If you would like to do something about this issue then you can sign the Whitehouse.gov [petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance). You can also donate to the [American Kratom Association](https://americankratomassociation.nationbuilder.com/donate) and/or the [Botanical Education Alliance](https://www.botanical-education.org/donate/). You may also contact your [Senators](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and ask them to sign Senator Orrin Hatch's letter to the DEA which has 9 signatures or Senator Ron Wyden's letter which has 3 signatures. You may also contact your [Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) and ask them to sign Representative Mark Pocan's/Matt Salmon's letter to the DEA which has 51 signatures. You can also contact the White House directly [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact). There is also a kratom [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/).

If you have personal experience with kratom then I highly suggest you [leave a comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006) to the DEA on the Regulations.gov website or alternatively [here](http://kratomcomments.org/#/5/).

It would be very helpful if the mods could sticky this thread while the situation is developing. The community must stand united on issues like this. We can't allow millions more Americans to be turned into criminals for using an herbal health supplement.
