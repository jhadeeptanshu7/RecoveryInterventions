I don't know if I'm sick or if I'm experiencing withdrawal symptoms. I started lowering my daily dose a few days ago. For the last two days I've been extremely dizzy, somewhat nauseous and my gut feels like it has diarrhea. 

I've never experienced dizziness or nausea from taking kratom before except once when I took a huge dose. I feel terrible and I can't function. I'm on the verge of crying. I only get moments of relief.
