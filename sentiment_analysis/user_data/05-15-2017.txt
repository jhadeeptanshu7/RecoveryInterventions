I have a friend who has been my friend for a very long time. She recently lost her dad and it has hit her hard. I think I'd like to set up an astronomy related adventure/tour if possible. Are there any tours available which take you to those really large and advanced telescopes and let you look into them etc? I think she would really like that and it would cheer her up some. Money should be no problem. 

However, I don't know anything about this stuff and don't have a clue where to start. I've read that there might be tours for this in Chile, but I'm not sure. Any help you can provide would be greatly appreciated.
