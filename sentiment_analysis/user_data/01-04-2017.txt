Dear Valve,

Please support the older Xbox One wireless controller natively. I don't want to spend another $20 on another program to enable this functionality. I shouldn't have to do that. I already paid $50 for a Steam Link and $50 for a controller. If another program can enable this functionality then Valve and the Steam Link can too. 

Sincerely,

A poor gamer
