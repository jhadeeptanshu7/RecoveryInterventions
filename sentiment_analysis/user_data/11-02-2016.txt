You can email, snail mail, or call the White House. If you email then it lets you choose the President, Vice President, First Lady, or White House Office. I suggest everyone do this. The email word limit is 2500 characters though. Apparently, the President reads 10 letters a day.

Edit: I'm mailing my letter today.
