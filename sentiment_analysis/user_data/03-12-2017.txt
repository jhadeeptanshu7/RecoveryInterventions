Sometimes I will briefly read a user review of a game and then rate it helpful, not helpful, or funny. However, I have found that sometimes I regret doing that for one reason or another. It is at this point that I would like to be able to retract my rating. However, there is currently no way to do that. Once you click one of the ratings you can't undo it. You can only change it to another rating.
