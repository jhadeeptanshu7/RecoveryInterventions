I'm selling my complete high end gaming PC and all the accessories. I've put MANY thousands of dollars into it over the last few years. However, I've been hit with gravely serious health problems and need to scrounge up as much money as possible. As you can see from the PC Part Picker link it is a lot of expensive hardware. I am offering it at a large discount.

Message me with any questions. I want to sell this as soon as possible. I expect it to go fast. Local pickup would be best (I'm in western Pennsylvania), but I will ship everything for free. I can provide photos upon request. You can buy from me with confidence. I've sold many things on Ebay and a few things on /r/hardwareswap. I can provide you with my accounts there to verify. All of the parts are in pristine condition. I've taken very good care of everything.

Price is $3200, but is negotiable.

Sincerely,

Riekopo
