I just had a showerthought about beards. I think that guys really respect beards on other men. Even if their beard sucks I think it still creates a level of respect. I have a cousin in law who stays clean shaven probably because his wife doesn't like it or he got made fun of by coworkers or something. However, the few times I've seen him with a beard I liked it and wish he had kept it. 

I honestly think it's a primal biological instinct to respect beards on other men. What do you guys think?
