I'm playing as Italy and I'm finding it really hard to maintain enough resources to keep up with my changing production. Whenever I change my Production which is often I have to trade for new resources. So I end up going to the trade screen constantly . It's pretty annoying. Is this how you're supposed to do things?

Edit: To clarify I'm not changing my production lines often. What I am changing is the number of factories dedicated to each item. So the resource requirements are constantly changing which requires me to constantly change my trade deals.
