I was playing as Italy in 1939 and sent my 3 best armored Divisions to Japan as volunteers. I took the Chinese capital and was about to take the next one when all of a sudden my volunteers got returned. 

According to the rules "They return home if their home nation finds itself at war or the country that received them finds itself at peace". However, I'm not at war and Japan is not at peace. 

This is infuriating.
