FYI, Kratom is a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant. People have used it for literally thousands (probably tens of thousands) of years for physical pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD, opiate withdrawal, getting off of opiates, etc. In low doses it's is a stimulant like caffeine without the anxiety or jitteriness and in higher doses it's sedating. 

The DEA tried to emergency schedule it (ban) in September. Because of a large backlash from people and Congressmen who signed a letter to the DEA about it, the DEA withdrew the emergency scheduling. This is a first I believe. There is now a "comment period" going on until December 1st where you can leave your comments about Kratom to the DEA. I also urge everyone to contact their Reps and Senators about this and ask them to sign the letter and fight to keep Kratom legal.
