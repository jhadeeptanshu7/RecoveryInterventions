I made a post about this 7 months ago and it garnered a fair amount of votes. I don't really like playing competitively online or dealing with all the shenanigans that sometimes entails. My internet is also not very fast and has a hard data limit. I enjoy playing against bots and setting up games exactly the way I want them. 

I was happy to see limited bot support added to Star Wars Battlefront and I was hoping EA/DICE would continue to expand on that. However, so far that doesn't seem to be the case. I would just like to express my desire for this feature/functionality. There is a segment of players that want this to return. I don't think it ever should have been dropped from the series in the first place.
