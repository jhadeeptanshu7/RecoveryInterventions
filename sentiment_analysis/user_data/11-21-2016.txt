I just wanted to point out the Congressional Progressive Caucus (D) and House Liberty Caucus (R). I think these two caucuses in the Congress would be our strongest supporters. 

The CPC has 69 members I think and the HLC has 36 members. There is also a House Freedom Caucus (R) which is basically the Tea Party, but I'm not sure if they would be friendly or not.
