I'm finding it hard to play the battles when I have a large force without pausing the game every few seconds or playing in slow motion. Neither of those options are fun, but the combat is so fast, especially when you bring a lot of firepower, that I have no choice. 

Is there a mod that slows down the pace of combat without messing the gameplay up?
