I'm fairly happy with my new Shield K1 tablet, but the battery life seems to absolutely suck ass. As soon as I start using it for web browsing or video watching it starts dropping like a rock. It also charges slowly as hell which I think is because I don't have a charger with the correct amperage. I'm not rich and I really don't want to pay $30 for the official charger.

I've read that this poor battery life is because of how the screen interacts with the stylus. I don't even have a stylus though. Is there anything that can be done about this?
