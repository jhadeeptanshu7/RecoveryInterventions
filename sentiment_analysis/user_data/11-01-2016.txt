Serious question. I'd have to guess that Kratom vendors are making millions of dollars at least in total. Business will no longer be possible if the DEA gets away with banning Kratom. The [AKA's](https://americankratomassociation.nationbuilder.com/donate) and [BEA's](https://www.botanical-education.org/donate/) fundraising goals aren't that high considering they're taking on an agency of the US Federal Government. It's in the Kratom businesses' self interest to fund these advocacy groups. It's depressing that they can't raise a measly few hundred thousand dollars. If the Kratom businesses came together they could easily fund these groups.
