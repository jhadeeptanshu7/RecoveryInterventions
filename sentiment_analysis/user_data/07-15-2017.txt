Italy is in North Africa and losing of course. I'm playing as Germany and want to help them as they did historically. However, I see no way to get my Divisions there due to the arbitrary and annoying naval supremacy requirement. 

There are a million enemy ships in the Mediterranean. I have a ton of aircraft flying over the sea zones, but that doesn't matter. I don't have many submarines left. My surface can't get past Gibraltar. What am I supposed to do?
