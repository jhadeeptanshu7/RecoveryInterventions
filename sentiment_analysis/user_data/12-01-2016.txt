I've been using my 2nd Gen Nexus 7 for a while now. It's been a pretty good tablet. Performance has gotten a little worse over time though. I'm also starting to experience hardware failures I think. I'm considering getting a new tablet and the Nexus 9 is my first thought.

Is this a good idea? I know basically nothing about it. Does the Nexus 9 feature haptic feedback? That's one big thing I missed on my Nexus 7. Thanks for any and all advice you guys/gals can give me.
