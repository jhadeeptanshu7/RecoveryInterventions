It seems to me that weather in this game has very little affect on what happens. This is especially disappointing regarding the German invasion of Russia. In real life the weather had a huge effect on that. Many German troops died from winter exposure and a lack of proper winter gear, many weapons became unusable, the extreme mud completely stopped or really slowed down the advance, etc.
