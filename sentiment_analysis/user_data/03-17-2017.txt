I'm considering switching from my Consumer Cellular plan to a FreedomPop plan. They seem to offer a completely free option as long as you stay within the limits. This seems too good to be true though. Is there a catch? I only make a few calls a month usually when I'm on the road. I only use data when I need help navigating with Google Maps. And at home I would always be connected to Wi-Fi. 

I have an unlocked Nexus 5. When I tried entering the IMEI number on their website it didn't accept it however. It gave me an error and told me to call them.
