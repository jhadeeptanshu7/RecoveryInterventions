I've been playing a lot of Warhammer and trying out a lot of mods. In small battles when there are not a lot of units involved the combat speed is not really a problem. However, when there are a lot of units involved and you bring a lot of firepower then the very fast pace of the combat becomes a problem.

In that instance, if you want to maintain control of what's going on, you have to play in slow motion or pause the game every few seconds. That's not fun and it shouldn't be that way. I think the combat speed needs to be slowed down by at least 25% maybe a little more. I hope Warhammer 2 is slowed down some and Warhammer 1 gets patched to be somewhat slower as well.
