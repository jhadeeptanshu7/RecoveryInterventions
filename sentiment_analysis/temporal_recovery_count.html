Also, how does the \"Demolition Team\" ability work on that TEC capital ship? Does it just go around blowing up your own ships or what? ","I'm new to Kava and have been increasing my dose. At first I felt nothing, but as I increased my dose I started to feel something. The best way I can describe it is that I felt very slightly drunk and it made me tired. Like I had one beer or something. I didn't notice any other effects like euphoria or increased sociability or anything. ","Is there a template for a letter regarding Kratom to our Congressmen? My Congressmen are Republican and probably won't support Kratom, but I figure I would send a letter anyway. Should I urge them to sign that letter to the DEA that was written by those Senators?","FYI, Kratom is a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant. People have used it for literally thousands (probably tens of thousands) of years for physical pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, PTSD, opiate withdrawal, getting off of opiates, etc. In low doses it's is a stimulant like caffeine without the anxiety or jitteriness and in higher doses it's sedating. \n\nThe DEA tried to emergency schedule it (ban) in September. Because of a large backlash from people and Congressmen who signed a letter to the DEA about it, the DEA withdrew the emergency scheduling. This is a first I believe. There is now a \"comment period\" going on until December 1st where you can leave your comments about Kratom to the DEA. I also urge everyone to contact their Reps and Senators about this and ask them to sign the letter and fight to keep Kratom legal. \n\nDPA letter to your Senators https://engage.drugpolicy.org/secure/senate-kratom-dea?ms=1A1_1609KratomSchedule&amp;utm_campaign=fy17advocacy&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=1609wsc3KratomSchedule&amp;cid=701U0000000xybsIAA&amp;_ga=1.145975412.1103595340.1477769831\n\nWhiteHouse.Gov Petition https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance\n\nKratom Comments website http://www.kratomcomments.org/#/5/\n\nRegulations.Gov comment form \nhttps://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006\n\n/r/kratom/\n\nDonate to the American Kratom Association https://americankratomassociation.nationbuilder.com/donate\n\nDonate to the Botanical Education Alliance https://www.botanical-education.org/donate/\n","","Thank you for contacting me about the scheduling of controlled substances and kratom. I appreciate hearing from you.\n\nAs you know, on August 30, 2016, the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) proposed listing the active materials in the kratom plant as a Schedule I drug under of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). However, in response to significant public pushback and citing the need for more research, the DEA is withdrawing its notice of intent to ban kratom. Instead, the DEA is opening up a period of public comment through December 1, 2016. You may leave your own comment by visiting: https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006. The DEA has also asked the Food and Drug Administration to expedite a scientific and medical evaluation and scheduling recommendation for kratom.\u00a0 \n\nI understand that many individuals who have used kratom consider it to be a safe alternative to other painkillers, which is why I am closely monitoring this issue. I also will keep your thoughts in mind should legislation regarding the CSA and kratom come before the full Senate.\n\nThank you again for your correspondence. Please do not hesitate to contact me in the future if I can be of assistance.","Serious question. I'd have to guess that Kratom vendors are making millions of dollars at least in total. Business will no longer be possible if the DEA gets away with banning Kratom. The [AKA's](https://americankratomassociation.nationbuilder.com/donate) and [BEA's](https://www.botanical-education.org/donate/) fundraising goals aren't that high considering they're taking on an agency of the US Federal Government. It's in the Kratom businesses' self interest to fund these advocacy groups. It's depressing that they can't raise a measly few hundred thousand dollars. If the Kratom businesses came together they could easily fund these groups. ","You can email, snail mail, or call the White House. If you email then it lets you choose the President, Vice President, First Lady, or White House Office. I suggest everyone do this. The email word limit is 2500 characters though. Apparently, the President reads 10 letters a day. \n\nhttps://www.whitehouse.gov/contact\n\nEdit: I'm mailing my letter today.","","What is the legal status of kratom in Canada? Is it regulated as a dietary ingredient or something?","","This time it's kratom, a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant. People have used it for thousands, if not tens of thousands of years for physical pain, anxiety, depression, insomnia, energy boosting, mood boosting, PTSD, etc. Many people have used it to help break their opiate or alcohol addiction. Kratom has saved countless lives in this way. \n\nIn lower doses it's energizing and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it does not cause respiratory depression like opiates do. It is about as habit forming as coffee. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands (possibly more than 10,000) of American kratom small businesses.\n\nThe DEA tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. They cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. They later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which are undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, food allergies, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is portraying then there would be millions of dead people. They were actually going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin which is beyond absurd and frankly insane. \n\nAfter the large public backlash the DEA temporarily retracted the ban. This has never happened before in the entire history of the DEA. It is historic. They are now doing a public commenting period on the Regulations.gov website (on track for the most comments ever) until December 1st while the FDA does an 8 factor analysis on kratom.\n\nAs an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada kratom is completely legal and classified as an NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that \"Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents.\" The Florida Department of Health added that, \"there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida.\" \n\nIf you would like to do something about this issue you can donate to the [American Kratom Association](https://americankratomassociation.nationbuilder.com/donate) and/or the [Botanical Education Alliance](https://www.botanical-education.org/donate/). You may also contact your [Senators](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and ask them to sign Senator Orrin Hatch's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/SenateKratomLetterFinal.pdf) to the DEA which has 9 signatures or Senator Ron Wyden's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/9.29.16LettertoDEAonKratomEmergencySchedulingFinalSigne1.pdf) which has 3 signatures. You may also contact your [Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) and ask them to sign Representative Mark Pocan's/Matt Salmon's [letter](https://www.botanical-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DEAKratomLetter9.26.2016.pdf) to the DEA which has 51 signatures. You can also contact the White House directly [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact). There is also a kratom subreddit.\n\nIf you have personal experience (not required) with kratom then I highly suggest you [leave a comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006) to the DEA on the Regulations.gov website or alternatively [here](http://kratomcomments.org/#/5/).\n\nIt would be very helpful if the mods could sticky this thread while the situation is developing. The community must stand united on issues like this. We can't allow millions more Americans to be turned into criminals for using an herbal health supplement.\n\nEdit: Some edits to clean up the post and add some info.","This time it's kratom, a plant from Southeast Asia related to the coffee plant.

Kratom has saved many lives in this way. \n\nIn lower doses it's stimulating like caffeine and in higher doses it's sedating. Most people take it in their morning tea. Though some take it in capsule form because it is so bitter. You do not become inebriated from kratom and it is not an opiate. It does not cause respiratory depression and is not a hallucinogen. It is about as habit forming as coffee. The primary alkaloid in kratom, mitragynine, is also present in the coffee plant. Kratom's effects are mild at most. Millions of Americans (estimated 3-5 million by the AKA) are using kratom today and have been for decades. There are thousands of (possibly more than 10,000 estimated by the BEA) American kratom small businesses.\n\nThe DEA tried to emergency schedule (ban) kratom in September. They cited as their reason 15 deaths over a two year timespan. They later admitted that those deaths involved other substances, which were undoubtedly the cause. Compare this to the literal millions of poisonings and deaths caused by things like prescription drugs, alcohol, tobacco, Tylenol, Aspirin, caffeine, food allergies, laundry detergent pods, etc. every year. This is actually a record of amazing safety not danger. If kratom was actually dangerous as the DEA is portraying then there would be millions of dead people. They were going to put kratom into Schedule I with heroin and meth which is beyond absurd and frankly insane. \n\nAfter the large public backlash the DEA temporarily retracted the ban. This has never happened before in the entire history of the DEA. It is historic. They are now doing a public commenting period on the Regulations.gov website (on track for the most comments ever) until December 1st while the FDA does an 8 factor analysis on kratom. You can read the thousands of personal testimonials from people who use kratom there. \n\nAs an example of how kratom is treated in other places, in Canada, kratom is completely legal and classified as a NHP or Natural Health Product under Schedule 1 item 1 (plant or plant material) of the NHP Regulations. In 2015 the Florida Department of Law Enforcement studied kratom and determined that \"Kratom does not constitute a significant risk to the safety and welfare of Florida residents.\" The Florida Department of Health added that, \"there are no pervasive health issues that can be attributed to the ingestion of kratom products in Florida.\" \n\nIf you would like to do something about this issue then you can sign the Whitehouse.gov [petition](https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/petition/please-do-not-make-kratom-schedule-i-substance)(complete) or Action Network [petition](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/do-not-place-kratom-on-the-schedule-substance-list?source=gplus). The [American Kratom Association](http://www.americankratom.org/) and the [Botanical Education Alliance](https://www.botanical-education.org/) are the two main advocacy groups. You may also contact your [Senators](http://www.senate.gov/senators/contact/) and ask them to sign Senator Orrin Hatch's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/SenateKratomLetterFinal.pdf) to the DEA which has 9 signatures or Senator Ron Wyden's [letter](http://216.30.191.148/9.29.16LettertoDEAonKratomEmergencySchedulingFinalSigne1.pdf) which has 3 signatures. You may also contact your [Representative](http://www.house.gov/representatives/find/) and ask them to sign Representative Mark Pocan's/Matt Salmon's [letter](https://www.botanical-education.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/DEAKratomLetter9.26.2016.pdf) to the DEA which has 51 signatures. You can also contact the White House directly [here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact). There is also a kratom [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom/). \n\nIf you have personal experience (not required) with kratom then I highly suggest you [leave a comment](https://www.regulations.gov/document?D=DEA-2016-0015-0006) to the DEA on the Regulations.gov website or alternatively [here](http://kratomcomments.org/#/5/). The deadline to leave comments is December 1st. \n\nIt would be very helpful if the mods could sticky this thread while the situation is developing. The community must stand united on issues like this. We can't allow millions more Americans, especially veterans, who have done nothing wrong and hurt no one to be turned into criminals and become victims of the Drug War for using a natural herbal health supplement. Especially a plant that has helped countless people break their opiate addiction, while we're in the middle of a huge opiate epidemic.

","I know the journalist Anthony Roberts at Medium did this and the DEA more or less refused to provide that information. I hope the AKA and BEA are following up on this. It's highly suspicious. I have contacted MuckRock and the \"FOIA guru\" Ryan Shapiro about this issue. ","I like HOI4. I think it's on the verge of greatness, but not yet great. It definitely seems like an improvement compared to HOI3 in some ways. However, in other ways I think it's a step back. I think in some areas it needs fundamental improvements and/or changes.\n\nPersonally, I'm not happy that fuel isn't a maintenance resource needed to keep your armies moving. Also, there is a near total lack of combat, battle, and war feedback which makes it extremely hard to understand how your forces are performing and what you need to do to improve them. The air war is just plain bad in my opinion. I'm not sure how to fix it, but I know it needs fixed. Something that really annoyed me with the air war is when I was playing as a small country I couldn't tell my small air force to defend just my airspace. They had to defend a huge region and of course they were all shot down extremely quickly. Internal politics are really shallow which is a shame. Not being able to stockpile leftover resources is really stupid. \n\nResistance to occupiers is pretty much a non factor currently because it ends as soon as the war ends. Attrition doesn't kill soldiers it only destroys equipment which really annoys me. Weather based attrition should be a huge factor like it was in real life on the Eastern Front. It should be extremely important for Germany to properly equip its armies with winter gear for example. The way army commanders are depicted is very fake. There needs to be more of a realistic command structure I think.\n\np.s. Anyone know why Steam won't let me write a review for HOI4? I had one written before, but it seems to have disappeared. Now, it won't let me write a new one.  ","","I've been using my 2nd Gen Nexus 7 for a while now. It's been a pretty good tablet. Performance has gotten a little worse over time though.

I can get 4 old games for the price of a new one and they are in many cases better games than the new ones.\n\nSomething I love that GOG does is they do some basic compatibility work to ensure every games runs on modern systems.

I tried using it with the GOG game Wings of Prey. However, two things are problematic. First, there is a huge deadzone around the joystick.

Feel free to add any other problems you've noticed with the Uplay Store.\n\n&gt; To whom it may concern,\n\n&gt; I have multiple issues to report. I just purchased the Assassin's Creed Humble Bundle full package. However, as I looked into it I became more and more confused. The Uplay Store appears to be a total mess. The first problem I have is that in my Uplay library two \"Assassin's Creed III\" are listed which doesn't make sense. This appears to be an obvious bug.\n\n&gt; If you visit the Humble Bundle website you will see they are only giving away Uplay keys. They are giving away \"Assassin's Creed\". However, on the Uplay store there is no \"Assassin's Creed\". There is only \"Assassin's Creed Director's Cut\". So what is going on here? Is their listing wrong or are they really giving away an inferior version of the game? When I activated the key it shows as \"Assassin's Creed\" instead of \"Assassin's Creed Director's Cut\". \n\n&gt; Third, we have the same issue again with \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\". Humble Bundle says they are giving away \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\". However, the Uplay store only lists \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Deluxe Edition\". When I activated the key in my library the game is listed as \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\". So, again I don't actually know what version of the game I have. If the Humble Bundle really is giving away the non-deluxe version of \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood\" then how are players supposed to get the DLC? The DLC for Brotherhood is completely missing from the Uplay store.\n\n&gt; Another issue I noticed is that on the \"Assassin's Creed Brotherhood Deluxe Edition\" page there is an option listed for \"Standard\". However, when you click it you get a 404 error.\n\n&gt; Yet another issue I noticed is that Humble Bundle says they are giving away \"Assassin's Creed II Deluxe Edition\". However, when I activated the key in my library it is showing as just \"Assassin's Creed II\". If you go to the Uplay Store there is no \"Assassin's Creed II\" listed, only \"Assassin's Creed II Deluxe Edition\". What a total mess! I have no idea what version of the game I actually have! If I really do have the non-deluxe version then how am I supposed to get the DLC? It is also completely missing from the Uplay Store.\n\n&gt; Another issue I noticed is that the \"Tyranny of King Washington Betrayal\" (episode 2) is completely missing from the Uplay Store. \n\n&gt; Another issue I noticed is that there are 3 DLC listed for \"Assassin's Creed Revelations\" when you go to its page. However, when you try to buy any of them you get a 404 error. So players cannot get any of the game's DLC. \n\n&gt; A final issue I noticed is that there are doubles listed for multiple games when you visit the Uplay Store through the Uplay application. On the web browser version of the Uplay store there don't appear to be any double listings. \n\n&gt; These issues need to seriously be looked into and fixed. There are probably more that I haven't noticed yet. The Uplay Store is in an unacceptable state of disarray and confusion. I look forward to your reply.","Can someone explain to me the illogical and unfounded anger that Cosimo has for Contessina after she literally saved his life from the noose?

It seemed to get power then, the CPU fan spun up and the other fans. However, nothing else happened. The RAM LED light turned red however. So I removed one of the RAM modules. \n\nIt then started up and allowed me to go to BIOS. However, when leaving BIOS it gave me this screen. Because it's a cheap PSU it only has two power cables for disc drives and hard drives. I had the Blu-Ray drive and SSD plugged in. \n\nWhen I unplugged the Blu-Ray drive and plugged in the secondary HDD I was able to start the computer completely. However, in device manager I'm seeing these tiny little yellow symbols. I don't know what that means though.\n\nAlso, I don't know if my GPU is actually getting enough power.

I know what the infantry 1940 Standard B division looks like from that Military History Visualized video. However, that's all he covered. ","I'm playing as Japan and I have to say that I'm extremely annoyed with the naval invasions. It's a huge pain in the ass to set up a naval invasion. Especially because there are so many different island groups to invade. Once or twice wouldn't be bad, but the need to invade a million different islands and fend off constant naval invasions is really annoying. It makes me not even want to play. \n\nI don't know why naval invasions have to be such a pain to do.","I'm playing as Japan and I would like to know exactly what I'm supposed to do to take advantage of that event popup about Hawaii that says the American fleet is there. It seems that a lot of my ships (if not all) don't even have the range to reach Hawaii. ","I want to invade and take over the Panama canal as Japan. I control Hawaii. However, the naval range still isn't enough which is really annoying. It seems like my ships have barely any range even though they are the latest models. ","I don't understand how the synthetic oil plants work. In the research tree the tooltips suggest that each level produces the exact same amount of oil and rubber (+7 and +4). Is that true?\n\nAlso, how do you upgrade oil plants you've already built. ","Is there a mod that improves the American Civil War at all? In vanilla I'm not very happy with it. And it's the main reason I have interest in Victoria 2. ","It seems to me like there is no way to damage a canal. I know you can take over a canal by controlling one or both sides, but there should definitely be a way to damage it and make it unusable without outright conquering it. ","I was just thinking that it's weird that infrastructure has no mechanical effect on resources in this game. Logically, if you completely destroy an area's infrastructure they should have a very hard time extracting, manufacturing, and delivering resources. ","I'm watching the new show Jamestown and it reminded me how brutal the first colonization attempts were. With fighting between European colonists and Natives, entire colonies disappearing or being abandoned, starvation, disease, failed attempts at resupplying the colonies, and even cannibalism. \n\nIt doesn't seem to me like the game models these things very well or at all and that makes me sad. ","","I'd like to know what the historical German divisions were so I can model my army after them. There's only one example in that Military History Visualized video.","[removed]","Can someone explain how the Technology Sharing and Construction Repair foci work? I don't understand them.","I've read about the historical production numbers of the combatant countries, particularly Germany. However, in the game I can never get my production level anywhere near that. ","I've been playing for many hours as Germany and I don't think any of my land based naval bombers have sunk a single enemy ship. How are you supposed to use them?","Italy is in North Africa and losing of course. I'm playing as Germany and want to help them as they did historically. However, I see no way to get my Divisions there due to the arbitrary and annoying naval supremacy requirement. \n\nThere are a million enemy ships in the Mediterranean. I have a ton of aircraft flying over the sea zones, but that doesn't matter. I don't have many submarines left. My surface can't get past Gibraltar. What am I supposed to do? ","I was waiting for a long time for Vega, but finally got tired and bought a different GPU. Can someone give me a general update on it now? ","After playing as Germany and losing every time I have to say that submarines make me sad. They are really pretty bad. There's a lot of problems with them. It's really annoying to have to split them all up into tiny groups, but it's the only way they work effectively. However, that means only a few of your sub fleets will have a commander.\n\nAlso, not knowing where the enemy convoy routes are is a huge problem. And the way the sub war currently goes is very wrong.\n\nInitially the German Uboats had huge success, but then that gradually declined. They had what they called the \"Happy Time\". However, in the game it's the opposite in my experience. My subs usually get destroyed in the early game and only become decent at the end when I've unlocked the advanced research and doctrine. \n\nOne strange thing I've noticed is that my subs seem to be shooting down a lot of aircraft which probably never happened in real life. Another issue is that even when my subs are doing decently they are never able to sink as many ships as they did historically. And destroying convoys doesn't seem to have much affect on the enemy anyways.\n\nBasically, subs feel worthless and pointless. I think they need more work than anything else in the game. ","I'm thinking about getting Halo Wars 2 for PC and have a question about the zoom. Can you zoom in and out using the mouse wheel? ","Does anyone else think it might be neat to have a \"reserve\" option for frontlines and fallback lines etc. Where you could designate certain units to be held behind the lines as a mobile reserve force.","I'm seriously annoyed with the Fallback line drawer. It doesn't seem to work correctly when you have to make tight curves. I see no way to fix it except doing everything manually. ","I was playing as Italy in 1939 and sent my 3 best armored Divisions to Japan as volunteers. I took the Chinese capital and was about to take the next one when all of a sudden my volunteers got returned. \n\nAccording to the rules \"They return home if their home nation finds itself at war or the country that received them finds itself at peace\". However, I'm not at war and Japan is not at peace. \n\nThis is infuriating. ","I really like looking at and reading the unit descriptions. However, a lot of them don't have a picture (blacked out) and only have the generic description. I think this is great flavor and adds to the immersion a lot. ","I'm playing as Italy and I'm finding it really hard to maintain enough resources to keep up with my changing production. Whenever I change my Production which is often I have to trade for new resources. So I end up going to the trade screen constantly . It's pretty annoying. Is this how you're supposed to do things?\n\nEdit: To clarify I'm not changing my production lines often. What I am changing is the number of factories dedicated to each item. So the resource requirements are constantly changing which requires me to constantly change my trade deals. ","I would really like the ability to alter the composition of Support Companies and Line Battalions. Most people probably wouldn't use this, but for a roleplayer like me who wants to create historically accurate Divisions it would be awesome. Also, the 5 limit on Support Companies per Division would need to be lifted in order to facilitate historically accurate Divisions. I see no reason why there is a 5 limit in the first place. If a player wants to create very strong Divisions that use a lot of equipment/supply then they should be able to. ","Does anyone know what requirements need to be met to gain the General traits? I'd like to try and create the perfect General with all the bonuses if possible. ","I have a Field Marshal commanding lots of Divisions. The units are all over the place doing different things. So I have lots of different plans. How do I activate just one or two plans instead of all of them at once?","I think at least submarines (maybe all ships) should have a port strike option. I know that there are multiple examples of submarines attacking ships at port. I'm not sure about surface ships. Submarine nets blocking submarines from passing were a big thing as well. Some of them were huge. The Germans put one across the entire Gulf of Finland and completely stopped Soviet submarines from passing.  \n\nCoastal artillery would obviously help to defend your ships in port. Maybe the width of the battle could be small so the attacker can't bring many ships to bear. State Anti-Air could maybe be a factor if they are attacking you with Carrier based aircraft. \n\nAlso, sea mines need to be added to the game. They were used extensively. ","Is there any way to see the total number of equipment you've produced for each piece of equipment? I'd like to know to compare it with historical numbers. ","I recently got Endless Space 2 and have been enjoying it a lot. I really love the interface and the visual element of space and land battles. What do you guys think Stellaris can learn from this game?","I was just thinking that it might be cool for there to be a doctrine that allows you to retain some of your planning bonus when you're being attacked on the defensive. Then you could quickly counter attack before your enemy is ready. ","","","Is anyone else really annoyed by this mechanic? I don't really understand the point of it other than to handicap the player. It's especially annoying if you're playing a minor nation and you really need to make better Divisions, but simple aren't allowed because of \"reasons\". \n\nIt just doesn't seem like a good mechanic to me. There has to be a better way of doing it. ","Is there a mod that generally improves the game? I tried playing vanilla and the AI and lack of formations and unit behavior (stance) options really annoyed me. It's like they designed the game to require constant micromanagement of all your units. ","I think it would be really cool if CA remastered all the old titles. They could make them compatible with modern OS's, add high resolution support, widescreen support, Steam multiplayer, Steam Workshop, Steam Achievement, Steam Cloud saving, and Steam Trading Card support, etc. Also release them on GOG.\n\nIt would also be good practice before working on the next major historical title. :)","","A lot of people are requesting a sticky thread to post suggestions in, where perhaps GSC Game World can pick a few good ideas from.\n\nIt can be left up as a sticky. (Mods please)\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/Cossacks/comments/53xwob/what_would_you_like_to_see_in_cossacks_3_thats/","[removed]","Is there a mod manager for Warhammer? I've downloaded a ton of mods, but I know I'm going to have problems with mod conflicts and load order. ","I'm finding it hard to play the battles when I have a large force without pausing the game every few seconds or playing in slow motion. Neither of those options are fun, but the combat is so fast, especially when you bring a lot of firepower, that I have no choice. \n\nIs there a mod that slows down the pace of combat without messing the gameplay up? ","I've been playing a lot of Warhammer and trying out a lot of mods. In small battles when there are not a lot of units involved the combat speed is not really a problem. However, when there are a lot of units involved and you bring a lot of firepower then the very fast pace of the combat becomes a problem.\n\nIn that instance, if you want to maintain control of what's going on, you have to play in slow motion or pause the game every few seconds. That's not fun and it shouldn't be that way. I think the combat speed needs to be slowed down by at least 25% maybe a little more. I hope Warhammer 2 is slowed down some and Warhammer 1 gets patched to be somewhat slower as well. ","Game of Thrones wasn't that great, but I still enjoyed it. Is this game ever going to get a sequel? I'm surprised there hasn't been one considering the popularity of the show. ","In the older games the in game encyclopedia was really nice and I spent a lot of time reading it. The historical descriptions were fascinating. The in-battle spell browser is really nice and is basically the same thing, but only for during battles and about spells.\n\nI think it would be really awesome if the spell browser was expanded to include all the information about the game and could be viewed on the campaign map. It would be really cool to see the unit models in that and read longer lore descriptions of everything. ","","[removed]","I don't know what the deal is, but it really seems like my CAS aircraft are not working anymore. They used to shred enemy Divisions, but now they seem to be doing barely anything. ","So if the enemy has aircraft in the air and has air superiority (51%?) then all of your Divisions in the region take a huge movement speed penalty when moving. \n\nHowever, that doesn't make sense to me because aircraft do not attack Divisions that are merely moving. They can only attack Divisions that are in combat. So your Divisions are getting a huge speed penalty just because there are enemy aircraft in the air.\n\nAm I missing something or is this just illogical?","","I just had a showerthought about beards. I think that guys really respect beards on other men. Even if their beard sucks I think it still creates a level of respect. I have a cousin in law who stays clean shaven probably because his wife doesn't like it or he got made fun of by coworkers or something. However, the few times I've seen him with a beard I liked it and wish he had kept it. \n\nI honestly think it's a primal biological instinct to respect beards on other men. What do you guys think?","My beard is mostly like medium brown color. Though there is some very slight red tint to it.

It's from 2013 so I don't know how accurate it still is though. I've put at least 1000 hours into CK2 and I had no idea about any of this combat stuff. It's actually very interesting which makes it a real shame that game basically doesn't tell you anything about it.\n\nI think the game should tell you what your unit stats are so you have a better understanding of their different roles. It could also summarize it in a rock paper scissors kind of way. It should provide more information about what tactics will be available based on your flank composition and your current flank leader. So you can organize your army in a way to maximize its effectiveness. During combat it should tell you if your current tactic is normal, good, bad, or cultural (really good). \n\nAlso, tactics are so cool that I think there should be more tactics introduced. And based on that thread it seems that some of the Retinues are not very useful due to them being light infantry which is a weak unit in general and doesn't benefit from any tactics very much. So maybe some Retinues should be changed. Also, I think I read that the Byzantine cultural tactic doesn't take advantage of their Retinue horse archers. \n\nFinally, you should be able to see what upgrades your Retinues and Levies have as a result of the buildings in their Holdings.
