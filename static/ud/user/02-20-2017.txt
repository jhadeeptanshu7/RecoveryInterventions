  How is your sex drive? Anyone have a problem with low erection quality and low to zero sex drive?i used to be on opiates and had issues with this, mostly the no sex drive part..now I take kratom for pain and it causes the same problems..sure I could get off but then pain flares up which stresses me out and makes me unhappy so that cancels out the improved sex drive..

  For those who had this problem, how did you  treat it? there are no practical solutions..maybe TRT but that adds its share of problems too
