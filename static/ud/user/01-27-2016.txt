  I hate to sound negative in any way but so many people that have quit kratom claim they feel a spark again, meaning their body and mind feels awake and alive again..this goes for other drugs too but I come from a heavy opiate background..when I quit methadone, I stayed clean from all drugs for 16 months yet I still felt crappy overall..sluggish, low motivation, just didn't feel alive despite exercising..the i was scribed several ssris, ssris Znd they didn't help..then of course I sought out other herbs, drugs and I found kratom..

  So I'm curious if anyone has been clean from kratom for a long time yet still hasn't felt that spark..if so, what are your plans?go back to kratom or?
