Im about a month clean from klonopin, feel better but not functional..my mind is very foggy, dizzy when I do something physical, no energy etc etc..im supposed to see a doctor on Monday as he will write me a few scripts that he thinks will help this benzo wd process out..yet everything I've read makes me think that there aren't medications that can help me out here..

 Right/wrong?what could a doctor prescribe me that would help?maybe a ssri could help my anxiety and restlessness?
