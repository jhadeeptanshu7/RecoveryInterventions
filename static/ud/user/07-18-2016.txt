  I combine different drugs and im a changed person..I go from asocial, no motivation, low interest to mr social, making plans and interested in life in minutes on these cocktails..yet I realize that no matter how many cocktails i take or switch around it isn't sustainable..somehow some way I will have to accept who I am, which is a very introverted, reclusive guy with mood/anxiety problems..also I have anhedonia so accepting this as who I am is almost impossible..I work out hard, eat right, I look good but when im sober I just feel off even after years..I've tried welbutrin, Zoloft, Paxil, phenylpircetam, l theanine, list goes on and on and they are barely helpful and all have side effects..

  So for similar people like myself, any nootropics or medications really help you out?getting clean I can do but pointless if I just go back to a guy with low moods and motivation problems..it's a vicious cycle
