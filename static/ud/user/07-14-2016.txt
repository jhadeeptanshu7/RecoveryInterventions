  It's very rare for me to just take one strain anymore so I usually mix 3-4 strains and wait..for some reason, So cals  red Borneo and green malay go together great.felt like one of their premium blends..I also tried mixing red maeng da with elephant and a very nice, smooth and long lasting burn!

  Anyone else mix and match?
