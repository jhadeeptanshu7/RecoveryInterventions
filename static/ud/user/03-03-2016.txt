  Bum yesterday..wtf, I have been using kratom for 7-8 months, 5-10 grams a day..it kills my libido so I took a 4-5 day break from it..then I started again yesterday, took green maeng da in the morning and instead of the energy rush I usually get, I fell into a strong opiate type nod..I didn't want to get out of bed..later that day, I took 5 more grams of red malay and just wanted to lay down and surf YouTube..wtf, I've never felt this way from kratom..hopefully the normal effects are back tomorrow..

  Anyone ever have this happen?i thought after a break the positive effects would be much better but nope
