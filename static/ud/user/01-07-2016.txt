I bought $100 from buy kratom a few months ago..3 of the strains I liked but e white Borneo wasn't very good..biggest problem with buy kratom is most of the time they are sold out of my favorite strains and minimum order of $100..fresh kratom has Some tasty strains in stock so should I just buy from them?do they have a minimum order?
