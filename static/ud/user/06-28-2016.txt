  say u really want to get knocked out and sleep for a full 8 hours, what do you take?tonight i found a great socktail..50 mgs of seroquel, l theanine, selegiline/Pea and 0.5 mgs of Clonozolam..holy shit not only am i going to sleep like a babay tonight but i feel so completely relaxed atm..it feels like almost heroin like warmth but improved sociability and mood..im very tired but i feel so nice i want to stay up for hours..this high has lasted me the last 2 hours..this cocktail is so fucking strong, im just curious how i will feel after i wake up tomorrow morning...if i will be groggy and out of it for half the day etc etc
