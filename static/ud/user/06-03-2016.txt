Selegiline hits MAOi and i remember reading that kratom does as well...would there be danger if i mixed these two together?Selegiline is an anti depressant but i wil start with low dosages, like around 2.5 mgs and keep kratom dosages low as well until i see how it feels..

  does anyone know if this combo would be dangerous?
