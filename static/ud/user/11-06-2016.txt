I was prescribed Cymbalta 5-6 days ago and ever since I started taking it, my kratom aroma has been very weak..now I had taken a month off of kratom and then started taking it again so I was feeling nice from low doses but ever since I started Cymbalta, I have to take larger doses to feel anything..

  Why or how Is Cymbalta interfering with my kratom doses?
