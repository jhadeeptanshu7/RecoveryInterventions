that follows it..there was a thread on here a few days ago about the long term health/mental damage drugs have caused us but im more focused on the long term opiate/meth users and their ability to feel pleasure long after they quit..i used opiates(nubain to oxy to heroi to methadone to kratom) from my early 20s to mid 30s..every time i kicked i would gradually feel better physically but i still had immense problems feeling pleasure..anything from playing xbox to working out to sex, my pleasure receptors just would barely turn on..even after almost 2 years clean of everything i was still suffering in this area...welbutrin and other anti-depressants didnt work..

  just curious if anyone else has been in my situation and if so, what has helped?keep in mind, i work out hard every day sometimes to no pleasurable effect, i have good diet etc etc..i feel like im fucked because well i cant enjoy life..
