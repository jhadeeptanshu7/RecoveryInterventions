  im talking about anything from caffeine to meth, what in your opinion is the worst thing about them?im going kind of through a selegiline/Pea withdrawal and the first 3-4 days of mind numbing emptiness was disturbing..now, im just lethargic and dont feel anything really..im watching tv and nothing makes me feel happy, sad, angry, excited etc etc..im like on maybe 6-7 day clean and only used my combo for a few months..i really dont like this state of 'non feeling'...i tried to exercise but that was a lost cause..anything else help this feeling go away?

  those that quit Meth i imagine feel like this for months on end..right?if so, how do you not eat a bullet or do you find lesser drugs to combat this feeling?
