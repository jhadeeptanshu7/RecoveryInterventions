This is something I have come to expect from kratom every once in awhile..most times I get a nice smooth burn where motivation, mood and energy is increased and anxiety is lowered..then I have the times when I notice a very dull mood lift, increased irritability and anxiety..usually it happens with white strains so I think this is the last time I buy a white.. 

  What are your bad burns like?oh yeah, dizziness also comes with my bad burns..
