  last year iwas ordering thru Cali botanicals and i get a call from my cc company saying someone is trying to buy all sorts of expensive items..i quickly had it canceled but it was a pain in the ass..now im going thru So Cal and usually use pre paid ccs but this time i cant..has anyone had CC issues ordering from So Cal or any other kratom company?
