 Last summer i was using so.ege.ine/pea, kratom and benzos on a daily basis..I wasn't eating anything and I rememver one night I went too high with the selegeline/pea and my vision got strange and I stood up, my body got stuck somewhat and I started pouring sweat..I couldn't move and I was stuck in a somewhat standing position..a few minutes later i was able to sit down..the next down I remember my vision being extremely blurry and typing was very difficult..thinks ng back now it could have been stroke? Thing is, the only thing I notice is my memory is bad at times so if I did have a stroke, it was very minor..is there any way I could somehow tel now if I had one of not? 

 You ever have a stroke? Any lasting effects from it?
