I have good sized kratom habit right now, 30 plus grams daily..I have 25 or so vicoden 5 mg tabs..the vicoden doesn give me any high at all unless I took 3-4 of them which I won't..anyways I was thinking of jumping off kratom altogether and once withdrawal gets too painful, I'll take a vicoden...I'll go through most wds but if it gets miserable, take a Vic, maybe half a pill..do this for the first week after I jump off kratom..how would this make me feel? What could I expect after I stop taking the Vic's?
