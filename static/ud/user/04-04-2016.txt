  we all know how well kratom works at giving you a quick and long lasting energy and motivation boost...for many thats the reason we started, i know its half the reason i did..for those that started using it for those reasons, when you quit, how did you fix the lack of energy/motivation?did you eat better, try meditation, find god lol..im very curious because i have come to realize over the years, its difficult to find something that works for these 2 things(energy and motivation)
