 No matter if I take provigil, welbutrin, ephedrine or any other stimulant I get the Nasty hand tremors, flushed face..the shakes are what bother me the most and can make me look like a crackhead. Lol..in the past I used low amounts of inderal and it wiped away the tremors and shaky voice but I've heard the stim/inderal combo is very unhealthy..I've tried l theanine, kava kava, phenibut but they don't help..benzos help but that's an extreme way to remedy hand tremors..lol..

  Any other recommendations?
