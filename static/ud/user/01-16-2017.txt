I took klonopin and clonozolam for 3 years, got off in September..I feel better but I was wondering if I could dose klonopin for certain social events without triggering withdrawals of any sort? Im going to give it another month and might try sporadic use..I mean literally, use it 1-2 a month..any former addicts go back to using this way?
