I live in Chicago and I am 21 years old. I know a couple that have been using heroin for many years..he got off and jumped on methadone at 200 mgs a day!! She just white knuckled it by smoking a ton of weed every day and gabapentin..he jumped off methadone 2 months ago but is craving and said he just feels off..she is craving as well so im sensing a relapse soon for one or both..should i tell them about krAtom? 

  Hmm if they were to buy krAtom and use it when cravings hit, wouldn't this still hit a few opiate receptors thus restarting their addiction? Yet, krAtom is better than heroin so
