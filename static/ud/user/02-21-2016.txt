  Since I started kratom I noticed a very bad effect, it killed my libido..now, my sex drive wasn't high before kratom but on it it's nowhere to be seen even dosing just twice dail..5 grams per dose..

  For those that quit, how long did it take before u felt your sex drive return?this is the only reason I want to take a break from it but I've read some reports where guys sex drives were still low even after 40 days clean!thats scary as hell to me..so please be honest!
