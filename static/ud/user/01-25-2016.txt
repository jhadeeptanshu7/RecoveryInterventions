I have a long history of opiate use..heroin and methadone, then got clean but NEVER felt good sober even after 16 months completely drug free..I was still tired, lacked motivation and just felt like shit and it drove me crazy..I started taking substances again and 5-6 months ago found kratom..I felt energy, motivation that I haven't felt in a long time..pain relief too but I worry that it might stop working for me..

  My point is, anyone else like me in that they feel like they function better on substances than off?people told me they felt great after getting clean but I never did..I tried the ssri route and they made me worse..I don't like having to take kratom but I gotta do what I gotta do..
