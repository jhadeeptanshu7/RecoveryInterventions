  I used opiates for many years, oxy to heroin to methadone..got off methadone and rememer even after 16 months clean from everything I still felt like shit..I had bad anhedonia, lethargic, low mood...I work out hard 6 times a week and eat right but this was my first damning insight that I've been forever altered by my drug use..a few others say they feel like I do as well even after years clean...I've tried medications but wasn't effective..

  Anyone here clean but still don't feel good or ok?are we just supposed to live out the remainder in our lives not feeling much pleasure or much more lethargic than normal?i mean, does anyone have the answer because my doctors are stumped
