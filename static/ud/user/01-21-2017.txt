 Damn here I am 5 months clean from benzos..granted I like the energy and clearer mind I have BUT the rapid thought, restless mind pretty much destroys my quality of life..I've tried therapy, other medications..I work out every day and eat right but still,maestros mind that only benzos helped..well, Ghb was the best but not sustainable..

  Im not saying im going back to benzos but it feels like a lost cause either way..anyone else in similar situation? To me it's all about quality of life and mine isn't that good off benzos..yet on benzos it isn't fantastic either but it's more tolerable..damn
