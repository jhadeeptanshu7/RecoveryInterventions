I have a buddy that is taking some sort of rc stim ..im not sure the name but I guess the high only lasts maybe 45 minutes and then shitty comedown, then he redose an hour later..all day long he does this, he wants to get off of it but claims the tiredness and low mood kill him..so what couldhe do to make it easier to get off this stim?

  I was thinking maybe 4-5 adderal and take one daily ?any other suggestions?
